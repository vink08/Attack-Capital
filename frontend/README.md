# Blog Platform Frontend

This is the frontend for a simple personal blog platform built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript.

## Features

- User authentication (login/signup)
- View all posts on the homepage
- Dashboard for logged-in users to create posts and view their own posts
- Responsive design

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Attack-Capital/frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env.local` file in the root of the frontend directory with the following content:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
   ```
   This should point to your running backend server.

## Running the Application

Development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Start production server:
```bash

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
